1. The schema is relatively easy to understand. My solution is divided into the main script where I handle most of the actions with different boxes. I also decided to use different ways to collaborate with my code, so I made the player as a class and import it inside the main. For the request and timer, I decided to use just a functional way(making them a function but separate from the main function) and then import them. For styling, I also made a style.css file that contains the main stylesheet for every box and then divide them to work with specific things.
